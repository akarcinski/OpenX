# OpenX
This is an interview task for OpenX. I decided to choose task 1 (tree data structure). 
Implemented public methods:

**Tree class:**
- numberOfLeaves - Calculating the number of nodes that do not have any children.
- pathLength - Calculating the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node.
- equals - Checking if two instances of data structures are equivalent to each other.

**Node class:**
- getValue - returns value
- getLeft - returns left
- getRight - returns right
- setValue - sets value
- setLeft - sets left
- setRight - sets right
- isLeaf - Checking if Node is a leaf
- equals - Checking if two instances of Node class are equivalent

I also implemented unit tests for methods:
- Tree.numberOfLeaves
- Tree.pathLength
- Tree.equals
- Node.equals
