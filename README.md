# OpenX
This is an interview task for OpenX. I decided to choose task 1 (tree data structure). 
Implemented public methods:

**Tree class:**
- numberOfLeaves - Calculating the number of nodes that do not have any children.
- pathLength - Calculating the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node.
- equals - Checking if two instances of data structures are equivalent to each other.

**Node class:**
- getValue
- getLeft
- getRight
- setValue
- setLeft
- setRight
- isLeaf - Checking if Node is a leaf
- equals - Checking if two instances of Node class are equivalent

I also implemented unit tests for methods:
- Tree.numberOfLeaves
- Tree.pathLength
- Tree.equals
- Node.equals
